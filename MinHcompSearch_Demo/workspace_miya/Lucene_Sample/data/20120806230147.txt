  . 1.3 Processing Boolrntr qumks 13. intersection can still be done by the algorithm in Figure 1.6, but when the difference between the list lengths is very large, opportunities to use alternative techniques open up. The intersection can be calculated in place by destructively modifying or marking invalid items in the intermediate results list. Or the intersection can be done as a sequence of binary searches in the long postings [ism for each posting in the intermediate results list. Another possibility is to store the long postings list as a hashtable, so that membership of an intermediate result item can be calculated in constant rather than linear or log time. However, such altemative techniques are difficult to combine with postings list compression of the sort discussed in Chapter 5. Moreover, standard postings list intersection operations remain necessary when both terms of a query are very common.. Exercise 1.4 i1]. For the queries below, can we still run through the intersection in time 0(x +31), where x and yare the lengths of the postings lists for Brutus and mam» It m» u h»..
